## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about building a background image from multiple pieces. 
The positioning isn't perfect, but in the end it works.
Again, another situation where I think it'd just be easier to create a single image in photoshop.

This was really more practice on the use of reducing the amount of code used, and using flexbox with more confidence.
